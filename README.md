# Alif Afiq - Accounting Portfolio
## About
With a Bachelor's degree in Accounting and Information Systems, I am building my career at the intersection of accounting practices and technology. This portfolio showcases my skills in financial reporting, internal controls, tax fundamentals, and the use of accounting systems such as SQL Accounting, MYOB, Xero, and AutoCount. My academic training and hands-on projects have equipped me to handle practical accounting scenarios such as journal entries, reconciliations, and reporting. I have applied accounting principles through simulated business cases and am continuously strengthening my understanding of audit procedures, compliance requirements, and financial analysis.

This repository serves as a space to demonstrate my accounting competencies, document project-based learning, and track progress as I grow toward becoming a well-rounded accounting professional.
